We posted content recently that’s specifically for developers writing games for Android:

			<h4>Texture Compression Format Targeting</h4>
Texture compression is a useful technology for games; by using a different formats, developers can achieve smaller download and runtime footprint as well as better runtime performance. But not all devices support all possible texture formats. So what’s a developer to do?
Play Asset Delivery now allows you to use multiple different texture formats in your App Bundle, and it will download the appropriate version based on the user device’s capabilities. For a quick overview of texture compression, as well as details on how to take advantage of this new game distribution feature, Check out this article from Daniel Galpin.
Improve Your Game with Texture Compression Format Targeting
Google Play Asset Delivery allows you to publish an Android App Bundle to Google Play containing all the resources your…

Or if you prefer your content in video form, here’s the same information, from Daniel’s Game Dev Show:

<h4>Texture Counters in the GPU Inspector</h4>
Speaking of textures and game development, Francesco Carucci posted a video to the Game Dev Show that shows how to use one of the features in the new Android GPU Inspector tool to track down performance problems related to the use of textures.
Textures are at the heart of the graphics that are rendered by games, and can therefore be at the heart of performance problems. The video provides a nice example of using the GPU Inspector, while talking about some of the problems around bandwidth, cache, and filtering, and how these issues are surfaced in the tool.

			<h2>Introducing Constraint Layout 2.0</h2>
			Constraint Layout is one of the most popular jetpack libraries and we’re happy to share that Constraint Layout 2.0 is out! It has all of the features of Constraint Layout 1.1 that you’re familiar with to build complex layouts quickly, with tooling integrated with Android Studio to preview your XML or even edit your layout.
Constraint Layout 2.0 brings several new features to Constraint Layout. To use it, bump the version in build.gradle.With the release of 2.0 we’ve also created a github repository for Constraint Layout. It’s currently a read-only repository and we are working to enable pull requests.
<h4>Flow</h4> <br>
Flow is a new virtual layout for building chains that can wrap to the next line, or even another section of the screen, when they run out of room. This is useful when you’re laying out multiple items in a chain but you’re not quite sure how big the container will be at runtime. You can use this to build your layout based on a dynamic size in your application, like screen width on rotation.Flow is a virtual layout. Virtual layouts in constraint layout are virtual view groups that participate in constraint and layout, but don’t add levels to your hierarchy. Instead, they reference other views in the Constraint Layout to complete the layout.
